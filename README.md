You will need to enter an option:

1: Used to change a texture of an item

2: Used to change a texture of a block

3: To close the program

## Change an item/block texture
If you select the 1 or 2 option, a list of items/blocks will be displayed in the console

You will need to find the item/block name in the list and enter the number that appears at the start of the line. 

For example, 204 to change the sugar item texture.

Once you enter the id of the item in the console you will see the selection and the name of the item you selected and a pop-up window will show where you will need to navigate to the folder where your new texture is and then select it.

(The texture should be 16x16 pixels and .png or .jpg)

Then after opened the image the program will start to add the new texture to an atlas (if nothing happens after clicked the Open button try pressing the Enter button on your keyboard).

If everything goes fine the program will print a Success message and the path of the modified atlas will be also printed in console.

The start menu will automatically be displayed again to select an option again.
